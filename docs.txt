OOP is similar to using structures the issue is that we can't declare functions inside a structure 
that's when OOP came in.

Declaration File (header file) and implementation file.

if you  want to initialize params in the constructor : use the initialization list syntax
example : 
    test::Test(char p1, int p2, float p3) : A1(P1), a2(p2), a3(p3){
        // CONSTRUCTOR CODE HERE
    }

CONST:
    a part from using it to declare a const variable we can use it after the functions declarations
    to tell the compiler that it is forbidden for the function to make anytype of assignstion meanind
    it can't change or set any variable value.
example :
   //declaration     void bar(void) const;
    //implementation void Simple::bar(void) const{
        //code here
    }

Non member attributes and non member functions :
    while using a non member function using the static keyword | don't use this keyword
